# Why I would recommend The Coding Train

There were some reasons that kept me away from "The Coding Train"... until recently.

I was trying to find some resources about Perlin noise while working on previous posts, and a usual source of good information is Youtube. There is a cornucopia of videos and channels that you can consult about many topics in programming, and material about Perlin noise with javascript and GLSL is not an exception.

However, every time I made a new query the Dan Shiffman's videos and his "The Coding Train" were always between the top 10.

[Daniel ("Dan") Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman) is the author of one of the most searched channels on Youtube about programming, ["The Coding Train"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).

Being a self-taught programmer, I knew of the existence of "The Coding Train" channel from some time. But I was reluctant to watch his videos further. I bounced quickly. 

There were a few reasons for that. The first was left to a first impression. Daniel Shiffman has an approach to communication that feels very chaotic and childish, and he himself makes that remark frequently on his videos. I felt a little adversion to that approach.

The other reason that kept me away from Dan Shiffman for already some time was more technical: Although [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/), the favorite Dan's development language, are both very powerful languages, I was more interested in vanilla-coding.

Furthermore, P5.js and Processing have become popular between artists willing to code. And I am not an artist coder. Let's clarify something: while learning to code I have come across a lot of very nice code made by artists and designers. At the end, some algorithms and techniques are just pervasive no matter the field and final purpose of the code, and those you can learn by studying code made by artists and designers too. Indeed this blog should be full of code made by artists and designers. But I have also discovered that the *emphasis* on some coding techniques and algorithms truly change according to the final objective of the code.

So I chose to open other videos while looking for information about Perlin noise on Youtube and skip "The Coding Train" as I always did. 

However, I was not satisfied with what I had found so far. At some point, I decided to overcame my prejudgement and give "The Coding Train" a better go.

I must frankly admit that at the beginning I was not very enthusiastic with what I saw. But if you overcome that first impression, ignore the comments at margin, and stay on, you will be surprised with an ordered, knowledgeable educator. Yes, Dan loves adding unrelated comments here and there, but the core content is usually presented in a way that follows a clear flow. The most interesting thing about Dan is that he is a graduate mathematician. Just like many other mathematicians and physicists turned programmers, Dan inserts a lot of concepts and theory. This is something that I enjoy a lot. However, Dan is aware of his main target audience and makes a good effort in reducing the complexity of the information without risking valuable one. And that works very well for me too.

For example, for a problem as difficult as Perlin noise, Dan Shiffman makes a very good simplification of how it works. On the screenshot below, Dan is at comparing between random (uniform) functions and Perlin noise.

More importantly, Dan's work is not limited to the youtube channel. "The Coding Train" is actually a work team led by him working different products and tools for those wanting to learn to code. Dan and his team have made available a book, ["The Nature of Code"](https://natureofcode.com/) (which can be get for free but also accepts donations), a [course on Nebula](https://nebula.tv/codingtrain), and a [website](https://thecodingtrain.com/), to mention some. Dan Shiffman has been member of the  Board of Directors at the [Processing Foundation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/processing-foundation/about/), and he has been working at [Tisch School of the Arts](https://tisch.nyu.edu/about/directory/itp/1984778605).

And although it is still true that his main audience appears to be mainly artists and that his main tool is still P5.js/Processing, the theorical content is very revealing and applicable no matter the tool you are using. Moreover, Dan also works with several other libraries that might be interesting for more vanilla-coders, so it would be unfair to say that he is only and just only P5.js/Processing. Not at all! There is more than that.

In short, there is more than I thought about "The Coding Train" channel. And then there is the book and the website. The book is particularly a very nice job, one that I would recommend to anyone willing to learn coding.

# Veredict

The only thing that I still don't like much about "The Coding Train" is the usual emphasis on P5.js/Processing. Don't get me wrong, I still believe they are fantastic libraries. It is just that I am not currently interested on learning them.

Apart of that, I will be using this resource more frequently. Now I have a lot of respect of Dan Shiffman job and his team and I will recommend it more often.

And you? What do you think? Is the kind of material that you would work for you? The most important is always finding something that make you feel comfortable. I hope you have found something useful. And with that, I wish you happy coding!
